# retrocross
Retrocross forum role-playing game CSS and HTML code. Also, some pretty old js (mostly in form of jQuery). Site: [retrocross.rusff.ru](http://retrocross.rusff.ru).

### DISCLAIMER
1. As of March 18, 2017, this code is almost a year old, and some parts of it (notably, scripts) are even older. CSS and HTML is still okay, I guess; my js skills are way better now, though.
2. Mybb.ru (or, in this case, QuadroBoards) is a free platform, and a very limited one. To expand on existing or introduce new functionality, one has to be very creative because s/he can't actually tweak backend. The only option is to make all necessary scripts on the front-end and put 'em at the top/bottom of the `<body>` tag, which one, yes, can do.
3. Comments are in Russian. I might translate them later, if I have time.

You've been warned.
